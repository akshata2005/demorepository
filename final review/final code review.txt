1)disck storage command
du -sh *
2)hello word.java
public class Helloworld { public static void main(String args[]) {
         while(true)
         {
            System.out.println("Hello world to terminal");
try
{

            Thread.sleep(6000);
}
catch(Exception ex)
         {
          System.out.println(ex);
         }

         }

5)difference betweent for and while loop: for loop is used for giving the range between particular number.and whlie loop is used for givivng the condition statement
6)function:this is used for reusing the particular code.we can use this code as many times in the program.
7)factorial of number : #!/bin/bash
read -p "enter the number for factorial:" num
fact=1;
for (( i=1; i<$num; i++ ))
do
   fact=$(( fact * i ))
   echo -n "$i *"
done
   echo -n "$num"
   var=$(( num * fact ))
   print "\n"
   echo "factorial of $num is $var"
and explaind the code .
8)selection: here we use if statement and elif statement.case statement

9)array:array is used for alloacating the memory.
